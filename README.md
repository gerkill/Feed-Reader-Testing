#### Project Description

In this project I wrote JavaScript unit tests using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) for an app that calls RSS feeds from several sources.<br>
<b>Test Suite 1</b><br>
is about the RSS feeds definitions and the allFeeds variable in the application.
Within this suite, Test 1 ensures that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty. Test 2 loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty. Test 3 loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
